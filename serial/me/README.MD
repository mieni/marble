In this folder there are diferent subfolders for the diferent implementations of the program

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder a
 
Serial version of the program, where the processing of the data is made during the simulation. 
Vacancies are NOT in seperate array. This implementation uses numerical recipes algorithm for random number generator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder b

Serial version of the program, where the processing of the data is NOT made during the simulation. 
Vacancies are in seperate array. This implementation uses numerical recipes algorithm for random number generator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder c

Serial version of the program, where the processing of the data is NOT made during the simulation.
Vacancies are in seperate array. This implementation uses the fortran function random_number for generating random numbers.
